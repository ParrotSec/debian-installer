This is a checklist of steps involved in updating d-i to use a new version
of the kernel.

 1. Compare available modules in new kernel and add any that are useful for
    installation to an appropriate udeb.
 2. New kernel package enters the archive.
 3. Update build/config/ KERNELVERSION to use new kernel (only commit once
    udebs are accepted).
 4. Make sure images still build, as sometimes new kernels will overflow
    space limits. If not, the kernel-wedge udeb configuration in the kernel
    package needs to be revised.
 5. Do initial test installs, which must be done against unstable to
    use the new kernel udebs from unstable or using hand-build CD
    images.
 6. New kernel package enters testing.
 7. Test to make sure lowmem installs still work. New kernels and
    added/changed modules sometimes break lowmem. Documentation on the
    minimum memory requirements may need to be updated
    (manual/build/arch-options/).
 8. Get new debian-cd uploaded and into testing.
 9. Full user testing, etc.
10. Update kernel version in manual/build/arch-options for the
    relevant kernel.
11. Inform maintainer of Release Notes of the changes in kernel version
    (or update ddp/manuals.sgml/release-notes/release-notes.ent in CVS).
