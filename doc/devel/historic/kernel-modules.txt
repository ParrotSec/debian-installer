Kernel module udebs in debian-installer
=======================================

anna is not magical, and thus needs help to figure out what to install
and what not to install. We want to minimize the amount of work the
user has to do here, and one step in this direction is to automatically
install all kernel module udebs. Actually, we only want to install the
kernel modules for the running kernel, so anna needs a way to figure
out
  1. Whether a udeb is a kernel modules udeb
  2. What kernel versino it belongs to
To solve this, we introduce the  XB-kernel-version  control field. It
will simply say
  XB-kernel-version: 2.4.19
for the 2.4.19 kernel module udebs, et.c.

The memory footprint is small, on i386 I think installing all available
kernel module udebs used up about 1M of ramdisk space.
