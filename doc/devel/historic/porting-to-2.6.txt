Porting debian-installer to 2.6 for your architecture
=====================================================

This is a fairly haphazard collection of notes on what you need to do to
port d-i to 2.6 for your architecture.

Kernels and build system
------------------------

  * Create packages/linux-kernel-di-<architecture>-2.6/ with
    appropriate sets of module udebs. There are plenty of examples to borrow
    from here.

  * Create 2.6.cfg files in installer/build/config/ for each target you want
    to ship with 2.6. You'll need to set at least KERNELVERSION,
    KERNELMAJOR, and EXTRANAME. i386 has good examples here. Use
    FLAVOUR_SUPPORTED in the parent config file to get 2.6.cfg to be
    included in the build system.

  * If your kernels don't have ext2 built-in (some 2.6 ones don't), set
    INITRD_FS = cramfs (or INITRD_FS = initramfs to live on the bleeding
    edge).

  * Add your architecture to the module-init-tools build-dependency list in
    installer/debian/control.

  * If you need different packages in your initrd on 2.6 versus 2.4 which
    aren't already handled by the build system, use [2.4] and [2.6]
    qualifiers (see installer/build/README).

Other packages
--------------

  * Make any necessary changes to packages/rootskel/debian/templates-arch.

  * Make packages/base-installer/debian/postinst install an appropriate 2.6
    kernel when d-i is running with 2.6 itself.

  * You may need to make some changes to hardware detection in
    packages/hw-detect/.

  * You may need to tweak packages/usb-discover/usb-discover, particularly
    if you're using a different kernel version from other architectures.
