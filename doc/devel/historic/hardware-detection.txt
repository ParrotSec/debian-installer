Hardware Detection
------------------

We want to do hardware detection in the Debian installer. What types of
hardware is it worthwhile for the installer to detect?

- hard drive (ide, scsi)
- CDROM drive (for CD installs)
- CPU (if we want to try to install a kernel that matches the cpu better
       than a i386 kernel on a pentium 3)
- NIC (for network installs)
- modem (for modem installs)
- pcmcia (hard drive, memory, NIC. Mostly handled by the pcmcia drivers, tho)

Ideally, code for detecting a given type of hardware should not be wasting
space on an install media unless that type of hardware is supported. So a
dedicated floppy and ethernet installer should not have to worry about
modem and cdrom detection code. This suggests that various detection bits
should be in separate modules.

We want to offer three levels of detection, and allow the user to chose
which is suitable:

- full detection
- passive detection (no probing)
- no detection

We are using discover for hardware detection, which works well, also
on non-i386.  Discover 2.x will also support *BSD and such better.
