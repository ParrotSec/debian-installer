<title>
The need for a synchronization process
</title>

<para>
The files which are really used for building &d-i; packages are hosted
in the <acronym>git</acronym> (Subversion) repository used for the development of &d-i;
packages. Each &d-i; package sources is hosted in a subdirectory of
the <filename>packages/</filename> directory, with a very classical
Debian package source tree organization, including the
<filename>debian/po</filename> directory where the package's
translation are hosted.
</para>

<para>
These files need to be synchronised with the so-called
<emphasis>master</emphasis> files from the packages/po directory, as
the translators only work with these master files. This
synchronization must work both ways with changes to original strings
going from individual packages to the master files and changes/updates
from the master files going to individual packages:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      When &d-i; packages templates are changed, the individual
      <filename>debian/po/templates.pot</filename> file will
      change. These changes have to be moved to files in
      <filename>packages/po</filename>;
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      When translations are updated in the
      <filename>packages/po</filename> directory, these changes have
      to be moved back into individual
      <filename>debian/po/*.po</filename> files for each package. This
      does not need to be done at each translation update but must be
      done <emphasis>before</emphasis> building packages.
  </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
The task of keeping track of the correct synchronisation is one of the
most important tasks of the &i18n-coords;. It is handled by the
<command>scripts/l10n/l10n-sync</command> script.

<para>
The <filename>template.pot</filename> is generated from the &d-i;
repository by merging together all
<filename>debian/po/templates.pot</filename> files. The
<command>scripts/l10n/l10n-sync</command> script may be used
for this. First check that no PO files stay in
<filename>packages/po</filename> when running it for the first time.

Switch a language translations to the master file

This paragraph is here for historical reasons and should be now
irrelevant as all languages translations have been switched to the

This process is meant to collect together all translations spread out
in the individual package, for one language, and merge them in a

<para>
An helper script named <command>switch-language</command> has been
written to handle this switch to the master file. Using it absolutely
needs that no action happens simultaneously on the switched language
files. Translators are requested to <emphasis>not use</emphasis> it
and rather ask one of the &i18n-coords; to do it for themselves.

Synchronization process
</title>

<para>
The <command>l10n-sync</command> script is run periodically by one of
the &i18n-coords;. It should preferrably be run on a reliable Debian
host such as people.debian.org and will update the general
<filename>template.pot</filename> and all PO files from individual
<filename>templates.pot</filename> files from all &d-i; packages.
</para>

<para>
While running, this script will also run
<command>debconf-updatepo</command> for each &d-i; package and will
commit back the regenerated templates.pot files (package maintainers
often forget running <command>debconf-udpatepo</command> when
commiting changes to English templates).
</para>

<para>
During normal development, this synchronization process is run once a
day. During release preparations, the frequency will be increased to
speed up the full cycle.
</para>

<para>
When operating on the sarge branch, the l10n-sync will also merge
translations from master files in the trunk branch, by using the
<userinput>--merge</userinput> option. Synchronisations on the sarge
branch only occur once a week.

<para>
This system minimizes race conditions which could trigger conflicts.
</para>

<para>
The conflict windows have been minimised as much as possible in the
<command>l10n-sync</command> script. However, in order to limit the
number of commits made by the script, files are not commited as soon
as they are modified (except by using the
<userinput>--atomic-commits</userinput> switch which slows down the
whole process a lot and triggers a lot of commit actions). So, the
script is sometimes likely to trigger conflicts. For that reason, it
will stop working on a <acronym>GIT</acronym> copy where <acronym>GIT</acronym> conflict files are
present. This explains why this script must always be monitored even
when it is scheduled to execute periodically.

</para>

<para>
This is a shell script (which may contain some bashisms until a

        <userinput>--commit</userinput> allows the script to

        dozens of commits. As &d-i; commits are sent to the
        development IRC channel and are followed by several &d-i;

        <userinput>PO-Revision-Date</userinput> field of this language

        the <userinput>--debconf-updatepo</userinput> defines the

        <command>debconf-updatepo</command> switch, often the
        <userinput>--skip-merge</userinput> switch which only updates
        <filename>templates.pot</filename> files and not PO files

    <para>
        the <userinput>--sort-order</userinput> switch allows giving

The script needs the location of the local copy of the &d-i;

</para>

<para>
When using this script with commits, the &d-i; copy must be as clean as

checks for possible <acronym>GIT</acronym> conflict files and aborts if it finds some.

<title>
The PROSPECTIVE list
</title>

<para>When languages are on early stages of translation after they have been added
through the new language process (<xref linkend="new-language"/>), they are
temporarily listed in a file named <filename>packages/po/PROSPECTIVE</filename>.
</para>

<para>
Languages listed in that file are excluded from synchronization, and,
therefore, PO files are not created in individual packages. As a consequence,
<emphasis>activating</emphasis> a language means that the language code is
<emphasis>removed</emphasis> from the <filename>PROSPECTUVE</filename> file.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>
List of handled packages
</title>

<para>
A special file, named <filename>packages/po/packages_list</filename>,
lists the &d-i; packages which are included in the master files. This
file also sorts these packages by order or priority for
translations. The strings at the beginning of the files are to be
translated first.
</para>

<para>
The &d-i; packages maintainers must request for their packages to be
included in this file, when they estimate that their package is ready
for translation. Only &i18n-coords; can integrate packages there, after
checking that the strings have been reviewed.
</para>

</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>
Synchronization script and automated commits
</title>

<para>
Being aimed to be an automated process with automated commits, the
script requires a few prerequisites to be run without user
interaction.
</para>

<para>
First of all, when run from a cron job, the script has to be able to
commit files. This means that the account it is run from should use a
<acronym>SSH</acronym> key with an empty passphrase and add this key
to the account it commits to on &git-debian;.
</para>

<para>
First, create a <acronym>SSH</acronym> key with an empty passphrase and
put it in a special file:
</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
user@host:~> ssh-keygen -t dsa
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_dsa): \
        /home/user/.ssh/nopass
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/nopass.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/nopass.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
75:fa:62:54:2c:34:09:96:ad:f2:57:cf:16:ce:74:69 bubulle@mykerinos
</screen>
</informalexample>

<para>
Then, this key should be added to
<filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> on &git-debian; for the
Salsa account (&lt;salsa_account&gt;) under which identity commits
will be done.
</para>

<para>
Finally, on the host from which <command>l10n-sync</command> runs will
happen, the following should be added to
<filename>~/.ssh/config</filename>:
</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
host &git-debian;
  user &lt;salsa_account&gt;
</screen>
</informalexample>

<para>
Of course, this actually means that this local account will then be
able to commit to &git-debian; with &lt;salsa_account&gt; as
identity, <emphasis>without further control</emphasis>. This means
that the account the script is run with should be very safely
protected.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>
Synchronization script control
</title>

<para>
Some mechanisms have been implemented to add more safety and remote
control possibilities to the synchronisation script.
</para>

<para>
First of all, before doing any work, the script opens a special file
kept in the <acronym>GIT</acronym> repository and named
<filename>packages/po/run-l10n-sync</filename>. The "run=" line in
this file mentions whether synchronisation should happen or not. If
the file contains "run=0", then the script will exit without taking
any action.
</para>

<para>
This mechanism gives all &d-i; developers with commit access to the
<acronym>GIT</acronym> repository a very simple way to disable the
synchronization script actions. For this, developers just need to
change the file and commit the new version.
</para>

<para>
While the script is disabled, runs can still be enforced by using the
<command>--force</command> swith, which will ignore the
<filename>packages/po/run-l10n-sync</filename> file.
</para>

<para>
While it is running, the script also creates a file named
<filename>.l10n-sync.lock</filename> at the root of the local copy of
&d-i; repository. The file is removed only after successful runs of
the script. When this file already exists, the script does not run and
exits with an error message.
</para>

<para>
This mechanism prevents running the synchronization script twice on
the same &d-i; repository checkout copy.
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>
Synchronization script automated runs
</title>

<para>
(this section should be updated when the script run conditions are changed)
</para>

<para>
The script actually runs under Christian Perrier account on people.debian.org.
</para>

<para>
It is run through cron jobs:
</para>

<informalexample>
<screen>
TODO
</screen>
</informalexample>

<para>
A special cron entry is also added in order to allow other &d-i;
developers to trigger runs of the script at any moment. They just need
to create a specialf "flag" file on people.debian.org (this restricts
the feature to official Debian developers who have an account on this
machine).
</para>

<para>
As people.debian.org is a woody machine and as the behaviour of
gettext utilities such as <command>msgmerge</command> changes with the
version of &debian; systems, &d-i; developers should avoid using the
script on other machines to avoid useless massive commits.
