debian-installer (20230515) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bump Linux kernel ABI to 6.1.0-9.
  * Switch source format from 1.0 to 3.0 (native).
  * Update translation-status for the release.
  * Add temporary workaround for broken graphics when using the “bochs”
    graphics driver (default in QEMU, where it is known as “std”) or the
    “cirrus” one, under UEFI/Secure Boot (See: #1036019):
     - The previous upload seems to trigger a color depth mismatch between
       GRUB which defaults to 24 bpp in its bochs and cirrus video
       modules, and Linux (efifb, built-in) that reports 32 bpp.
     - This affects both the text installer and the graphical installer.
     - To avoid running into those issues, and until a better solution is
       determined, ship extra DRM modules for those graphics drivers:
       bochs.ko, cirrus.ko, plus their dependencies.
     - Limit the workaround to amd64, arm64, and i386 (where UEFI/Secure
       Boot are relevant), when drm.ko is detected in the build tree,
       copying files from the relevant linux-image package.
     - Add linux-image-6.1.0-9-amd64-{amd64,arm64,686,686-pae} to
       Build-Depends accordingly.
  * Many thanks to Ben Hutchings for the kernel-side insights!

debian-installer (20201202) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Bump Linux kernel ABI to 5.9.0-4
  * Drop fontconfig tweaks introduced in version 20170828 (See: #873462):
     - Full hinting support was removed upstream, in pango 1.44.
     - Forcing truetype:interpreter-version=35 through FREETYPE_PROPERTIES
       now leads to arguably worse rendering than with default settings.
  * With or without the aforementioned changes, the rendering looks much
    worse than it used to (until Debian Installer Bullseye Alpha 3), due
    to a behavioral change in pango. Since it affects default fonts, and
    not only in the installer's context, one might have hoped for a fix
    at some point but that doesn't seem to be happening. We might try to
    use different fonts to try and dodge this issue… Until then, here
    are some pointers to bugtracker entries:
     - https://bugs.debian.org/956612

    like libgcc1. Remove libc* and libnewt0.52 from that list.
  * Install kmod-udeb instead of libkmod2-udeb now that the library and the
    binaries are properly packaged in different udebs.
  * Remove the mklibs library reduction pass. Add a hack to copy
    libgcc_s.so.[124] from the host filesystem as it is not done anymore by
    mklibs. This needs to be replaced by a proper udeb.

  * build/util/efi-image: Fix up FAT filesystem size calculation:
    - We appear to need 32k headroom, not 24k; this was masked

    define it if unset, or fall back to 'now' if build/Makefile is
    directly invoked.

    supported.
  * Exclude usb-serial-modules from the armel network-console image
    since it's not useful there (Closes: #809301).

    - tftp: required since GRUB 2.02 otherwise PXE boot will crash/hang
    - gfxterm_background: required since GRUB 2.02 for the boot splash
      image functionality to be available
    - raise the grub-pc (and indirectly grub-common) build dependency to
      >= 2.02~beta2~ on these architectures, because module
      gfxterm_background did not exist in GRUB 2.00
    - raise the xorriso build dependency to >= 1.3.2-1~ on these
      architectures, for compatibility with grub-mkrescue in GRUB 2.02

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove desktop selection from syslinux; now available in tasksel.

  * build/Makefile: Use $(GZIP) instead of gzip, and prefer pigz over

    in tasksel 3.19 (Closes: #738602).
  * Update copyright years in boot screens.
  * Bump linux kernel version from 3.12-1 to 3.13-1.
  * build/config/{amd64,i386}.cfg: Remove old "video=vesa:ywrap,mtrr" option
    from VIDEO_MODE_GTK (See: #395040). DirectFB apparently needed those at
    some point. Let's see whether letting the kernel do its job just works.
  * build/Makefile: Add “| sort” after some find calls, to reduce entropy
    and notably to make build logs more easily post-processable.
  * build/Makefile: Move the drop_lang definition to the top of the file to
    deal with incompatible changes in make 3.82 leading to the following
    error: “recipe commences before first target” (Closes: #720719).
  * build/README: Mention USE_UDEBS_FROM in the recipe at the top, and add a

  * Remove iop32x flavour on armel since support has been dropped from the
    linux package (in 3.13-1~exp1).
  * config/kfreebsd.cfg: Put xorriso's -J flag after “--” to work around

    similar to efi-image script, with factorized grub-cpmodules part, to build
    minimal grub images with iso9660 and biosdisk support, and put GRUB modules

    version number).
  * Add cdebconf-newt-terminal to most images that include
    cdebconf-newt-udeb (although not floppies).
  * Introduce *_SUPPORTED_EXTRA variables, which can be used to define
    "optional" supported targets. Use this to allow monolithic to be built
    without having to edit configuration files and without bloating official

  * Use os-prober-udeb rather than os-prober for powerpc monolithic target
    (thanks, Wartan Hachaturow).
  * Filter udeb dependencies based on Kernel-Version and Subarchitecture
    (closes: #490634).
  * Filter out packages that don't match KERNELVERSION from downloaded
    Packages files. Despite the above change, apt still seems to want to

  * Clear Dir::Etc::sourceparts in build/util/pkg-list, to match
    build/util/get-packages.
  * Fix spelling of mdcfg in menu-item-numbers.txt.

  * Drop obsolete boot args from alpha netboot images.
  * Switch alpha cdrom images from initrd to initramfs (untested, but should
    work).

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Changes to target lenny.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Drop build dependency on modutils (only needed for 2.4 kernels).
  * Excluding non-us for sources.list.udeb should no longer be needed; add
    exclusion for volatile.debian.{org,net}.
  * x86: document parameters to disable ACPI and USB on F6 isolinux help screen.
  * Switch i386, amd64, sparc and s/390 to 2.6.20-1.
  * Don't include usb-discover in images as USB modules should be loaded
    automatically now.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Don't try to mount devfs if $(TREE)/etc/udev exists.
  * Remove apparently-stray test for /dev/tty that broke tree_umount target
    for udev builds.
  * Run the demo in the C.UTF-8 locale.
  * Correct partman-auto-recipe.txt's descriptions of the $defaultignore,
    $lvmignore, and $lvmok specifiers to include the $.

  * Remove DECstation images because these machines are no longer supported.
  * Switch mips, mipsel and arm to 2.6.20-1.
  * Cobalt: don't turn the serial console on explicitly since this will
    kill Qube 2700 boxen and it's on by default on those machines with
    a serial console anyway.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Exclude pciutils-udeb from the i386 root floppy as it's out of space

  * Switch i386, amd64, alpha and s390 to 2.6.21-1.
  * Include the default release for the target system and the release from
    which to retrieve udebs in images. The first makes it unnecessary to
    hardcode the default release in choose-mirror and the last ensures
    consistency between udebs included in the initrd and udebs retrieved
    during the installation. See #424640 and #426303.
    Requires net-retriever 1.18.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Stop including KEYRING onto initrds. Needs base-installer 1.80 and

  * Use BASEVERSION variable for powerpc to avoid needing to modify the kernel
    version for each flavor separately.
  * G-I for i386 is now also affected by the VT switching issue that earlier
    affected only amd64 (#373253). Include libgcc_s.so.1 to work around this.
  * For i386 and amd64, add the 'quiet' kernel boot option for all boot
    methods except expert mode. This reduces the amount of output to the
    console to only a few messages before the first D-I dialog is displayed.
  * Drop build dependency on mkisofs for s390 as we don't need it there.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Changes to support new wireless nic modules udeb.
  * Switch i386 to have 3 net-drivers floppies. The second one now contains
    wireless, usb, and pcmcia drivers, while the third contains
    nic-extra-modules.
  * Set APT::Install-Recommends=false in get-packages as a preventive measure
    to avoid getting recommended udebs when apt later defaults to installing
    recommends. (Mostly a no-op as there are very few udeb recommends
    currently.)

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Increase build dependency on mklibs to version 0.1.23; needed to avoid
    build failures or broken images after post-Etch toolchain changes.
  * Switch alpha, amd64, arm, i386, m68k, mips, mipsel and s390 to 2.6.21-2.
  * Get rid of hardcoded kernel versions in boot configuration files for mips
    and mipsel; rename bootscreen-subst to bootvars-subst to reflect this
    somewhat more general use of this script.
  * Drop compatibility symlink to old location of the graphical mini.iso.

  * n2100: Add support for Evesham's M-Box.
  * Put in a workaround to support building with both apex 1.4.7 and the
    new 1.4.14 which changes the name of the apex binary; closes: #409747

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Stop using the system status file; generate a dummy status file for apt
    containing libc6 and libnewt (the only two debs udebs still depend on).
  * dhcp3-client-udeb is for some reason Standard priority, so gets included
    in monolithic image builds (and breaks the build). Exclude it from the
    monolithic images until its priority is fixed.
  * The i386 boot floppy will be too big with the 2.6.18 kernel, so drop
    usb input modules from it. USB keyboard support didn't work before
    anyway AFAICS, since usb-discover was not included.
  * With 2.6.18, nic-extra-modules gets too big to fit on the i386
    net-drivers-1 floppy with nic-modules. Move nic-extra-modules to
    net-drivers-2 and reorg to fit.
  * Don't exclude usb drivers from driver floppies; the root floppy does not
    currently load them.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Switch amd64, hppa, sparc and s/390 to 2.6.18-3.
  * On amd64 we temporarily need to include /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 in g-i initrds
    to work around #373253 until upstream can remove pthread_cancel() calls in
    directfb. Because of the Etch release this is implemented for now by
    setting EXTRAFILES in the relevant files under config/amd64.
  * daily-build: keep file attributes between build targets if fakeroot is
    used. Closes: #401603.
  * Raise minimal memory requirement in boot help screens on x86 to 32MB.
    Closes: #402276.
  * Makefile: don't strip "Choices-C" fields from templates if DROP_LANG is set
    (see #400263).

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Copy the keyring from debian-archive-keyring into images (was using the
    old keyring from apt). Build-depend on a current version of
    debian-archive-keyring for good measure.
  * Fix stripping of kernel modules by Makefile, was broken due to bogus find
    command.
  * /etc/apt/trusted.gpg can't be guaranteed to be readable, and the udeb
    download will fail to verify if it's not. Avoid this by making apt use
    KEYRING.

    on Altix systems, though it cannot be used with 2.4 kernels

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove udev-udeb from the ADS cf image.
  * Rename gtk-miniiso targets to netboot-gtk, and place the resulting files
    under the netboot/gtk/ directory. Add full set of netboot files for the
    gtk image, not just the mini.iso. The gtk-miniiso directories are kept
    working via symlinks for now, so that we won't have to update the docs so
    late in the release process. Closes: #408535

  * Merge most differences between i386 and amd64 configs. Only remaining
    difference is that floppy support is still desirable (though not

  * Split off PRESEED_SUITE from PRESEED, use this for the suite setting

    Should fix cobalt issues.
  * Audited the x86 kernel parameter docs in the boot screens vs the 2.6.15

    kernel's kernel-parameters.txt, and to a certian extent read the source
    to find places where kernel-parameters.txt is wrong, and removed those
    too. It's probably better to not document things than to document them
    incorrectly.
  * Modified kernel parameter docs to use the module.param=value syntax
    for all parameters that are owned by a loadable kernel module. The old
    param=value at the boot line won't work, since d-i doesn't pass kernel
    command line to modules. The new syntax requires rootskel 1.30 to work.

  * Patch from Samuel Thibault to support testing CD-ROM images in qemu.
    Closes: #367068
  * Add documentation for brltty= boot parameter (hope I got it right).
  * Apply Samuel Thibault's patch to add brltty-udeb to the cdrom, netboot,
    nativehd, and hd-media images. Closes: #355851
  * Mark usb-serial-modules added by brltty patch as optional, since they're
    not yet available on all arches.
  * Increase size of the hd-media images from 128 mb to 256 mb to make more
    room for the netinst.
  * Put modutils udebs back on 2.4/2.2 images since new busybox has dropped
    all support for that.
  * Stop building el-torito i386 image, it's too big due to above busybox
    change.
  * i386 floppy is full due to above busybox change, moved half the network
    stuff the the net-drivers floppy, which now must be used for all network
    installs.
  * i386 bootfloppy is broken:
    mount: Couldn't setup loop device
    No idea why. Disabled i386 root and boot floppies. :-(
  * Add EXTRAUDEBS variable which can be used to pull in extra udebs for
    library reduction that are not on boot images.
  * Include cdebconf-newt-entropy in EXTRAUDEBS so that its symbols are in the
    boot images; since it is linked into cdebconf which uses the reduced libc.
  * No more parted build dep; those udeb deps are fixed.

  * Workaround syslinux weirdness on hd-media images; when asked to boot
    2.6/linux, it tries to boot "2.6/l". Rename files out of directories to

    included yet.
  * Switch hppa to 2.6.16-2.

  * Include USB-MAC keymaps again for powerpc with 2.6 kernels; they've been
    re-enabled in kbd-chooser for that architecture.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Switch from using DEBCONF_PRIORITY and sometimes debconf/priority to
    consistently using priority=low to boot to expert mode. Needs preseed
    1.17.
  * Change x86 help screen to document fb=false alias.
  * Remove libtextwrap1 from build deps and pkg-lists/exclude; cdebconf
    now uses the library udeb.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Remove all *.prospective files as all these languages are only used in
    the graphical installer.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove mountfloppy from netboot/common list, add it to only arches that
    support floppies.
  * Don't include brltty on the netboot image for nslu2 machines,
    which uses network-console. Actually, I removed it from images for arches
    except for alpha, amd64, i386, ia64, and powerpc, since the other netboot
    images seem to lack serial-modules.
  * Remove local copy of slugimage and use the debian package.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Disable powerpc/apus as the 2.4 kernels it currently uses were removed
    from the archive.

  * Copy in EXTRAFILES before depmod so modules can be included if necessary.
  * Remove libiw udeb from netboot-minimal/powerpc.cfg, will be pulled in by
    mklibs/deps as needed.
  * During library reduction, copy in libraries from driver disks same as
    other libraries so mklibs knows where to find them. This is a hack to
    let mklibs work if building a root floppy with driver disks that include
    libraries that are not on the root floppy. It's not ideal, since the
    library gets added to the root floppy by mklibs now. (This issue currently

  * Add preseed-common to all initrds, split out from file/network-preseed.
  * Add initrd-preseed too.
  * Add a PRESEED variable, which can be used to specify a preseed file to
    add to the initrd in the location initrd-preseed expects to find one
    (/preseed.cfg).
  * Default PRESEED to unstable.cfg, which sets mirror/udeb/suite, which
    means that all d-i developmental and daily builds that download udebs
    will download them from unstable, not testing.
  * However, in release builds of the package, this is unset, so those will
    pull udebs from testing as previously.
  * Try adding root=/dev/fd0 to the silo.floppy.conf since at least the 2.4
    kernel floppies are reported to not boot without it. This change may
    also affect the 2.6 kernel floppies, which need to be tested.

  * Add "install24" and "expert24" labels to syslinux configs, in
    preparation for making i386 use 2.6 by default.
  * Turn on dependency resolution for nic-extra-modules, especially useful
    since it has a new dependency in 2.6.11.
  * Turn on dependency resolution for standard-udebs and
    kernel-module-udebs. This allos most of the mess in monolithic/common
    to be removed as the dependencies pull most of it in, except where
    they're still broken.
  * When preseeding mirror/suite, don't make it be seen, so user can
    override from the default.
  * Recent additions (initrd-preseed) made the el-torito image too big on
    i386, drop usb CD support from it to make it build again.
    Stop abusing the build system in sparc.cfg by pretending that cdrom
    and miniiso are subarches. Add a "combined" subarch for these images
    that really contain both sparc64 and sparc32 support.
  * Included 2.6.8 kernel for amd64. Closes: #307306
  * Add support for creating initramfs initrd images (needs rootskel 1.12).
  * Move /unifont.bgf into lib. Needs rootskel 1.12.
  * Resisted the urge to drop i386 el-torito images, which filled up again
    once 2.6 fb-modules was fixed, and instead just dropped all translations
    from these (unused) images.
  * Add rescue-check to all images.
  * Add rescue, rescue24, and rescue26 boot options in syslinux.
  * To document these in syslinux, removed the old, useless f9.txt, and
    shifted f4 through f8 up one; the new f4 documents rescue mode.
  * Updated one place in the manual that referred to fn documents to reflect
    above change.
  * Document rescue mode in ia64 boot screens, but don't add stanzas for it
    since that would go over the limit of 16. Users will have to type
    rescue/enable=true
  * Add stanzas for rescue mode and document in sparc boot screen.
  * Remove devfs=mount from syslinux.cfg. Needs rootskel-bootfloppy 1.13.
  * Use dependency resolution for floppy-retriever, since mountfloppy has
    been split off of it and into a dependency.
  * Add bugreporter-udeb to the i386 root floppy, to cdrom images, and even
    to netboot images, so users can use it to report bugs earlier. Add
    commented out versions to other images on which it won't be very useful,
    since it currently required floppy support.
  * Update the manual for the /var/log/debian-installer ->
    /var/log/installer move.
  * Update the manual for the bugreporter-udeb rename, and for its

  * Updates for libiw28. Remove libiw27 from build deps and from exclude
    list, since the udeb is in fact used now to provide the library and
    netcfg's dependencies have been fixes. Enable dependency resolution
    for netcfg. Now no more updates should be needed here when libiw
    changes.
  * Temporarily disable nano from all images, as it's linked to slang2 and
    the rest of d-i is not, and library reduction cannot cope with two
    slangs.
  * Change udeb list format to match file format expected by katie (add
    arch field).
  * Make update-manifest also manage a MANIFEST.udeb file listing the udebs
    inside each file in the manifest, and pass prameters to update-manifest
    calls to provide this information.
  * Include a udeb.list, based on the MANIFEST.udeb, but munged so katie can
    read it natively, inside the images tarball. This will be used to
    ensure that sources for d-i images do not fall out of the archive.

  * Add file-preseed to netboot image so file-based preseeding can be used on
    netboot mini iso.
  * Remove file-preseed from netboot; that won't work since netboot never
    mounts a CD, duh.
  * Enable text frontend for netboot on all arches.
  * Aribitrarily increased sparc ramdisk_size to 9000 from 8192, since
    it's at least 8230 big now due to added languages.
  * Build-depend on newest libdebian-installer as some udebs have a versioned
    dependency on it.
  * Switch i386 to 2.6.12 kernel.
  * Add support for running upx on binaries inside the initrd, and turn it
    on for a marginal space gain in the (full) i386 boot floppy.
  * Remove usb floppy support from speakup boot floppy since it's terminally
    low on space.
  * Add comments to control file about build deps and add genbuilddeps which
    generates the build dep line based on the comments.
  * As part of the review, removed ncurses-base (not used since we got the
    terminfo udeb), and libnewt0.51 (pulled in by a dep from libnewt-dev)
    and cpio (WTF?)

  [ dann frazier ]
  * Switch ia64 to 2.6.12 kernel.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Turned on dependency resolution by default for udebs in pkg-lists.
  * Add libnss-files-udeb to exclude list to work around bug #322506
    (removed again as #322506 was fixed and the exclusion broke
     network-console for S/390 - FJP).
  * Optimise pkg-lists a bit.
  * rootskel-locale renamed to installation-locale.
  * Move md5sums and udeb.list generation into "release" target of
    build/Makefile and run these as part of the daily build too.
  * Cleaned up various userdevfs cruft, goes along with a reworked
    userdevfs udeb.
  * As part of userdevfs cleanup, removed m68k initrd22 images,
    the regular initrds should work wih 2.2 kernels.
  * Add ads subarch for arm, with a "cf" image flavour used to boot
    various ADS arm boards from compact flash. There is not yet a kernel for
    these boards in Debian, so the images do not include a kernel and must be
    used with a monolithic kernel (from ADS).
  * The stats targets no longer build any images. If the image is not built,
    it just won't display stats for it. This is mainly to work around a bug
    that affected the daily builds, where running stats in a separate fakeroot
    after the build would run build again, and rebuild initrds based on the
    trees in tmp, messing up permissions and devices. It also removes a lot of
    unnucessary work in stats, and allows simpler invocation of stats by
    the daily-build script.
  * Don't regenerate the list of udebs in an image in stats, this was
    redundant info and was slow and ugly to generate there.
  * Remove config/local from svn and add a comment to config/common about
    making the file.
  * Add an evil workaround for bug #329733.

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Enabled powerpc64 support.
  * Killed all 2.4 powerpc kernels except apus.
  * Upgraded to 2.6.12 powerpc kernels.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Change dependency to libparted1.6-13 due a new soname change on parted
    1.6.24.

  [ Dann Frazier ]
  * Drop the Linux 2.4 support for ia64.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Temporarily disabled powerpc floppy builds since they depend on miboot
    kernel udebs that are not in the archive.
  * Temporarily made it build against udebs in sid when releasing this
    package, since it's taking too long to get udebs into etch for a release.

    - Do an e2fsck for the extra floppy images.
    - Handle sparse files in cramfs images more efficiently.
    - Use cramfs images for mips/r4k-ip22 and mips/r5k-ip22.
    - Add cramfsprogs build-dep for mips.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add acpi-modules to the amd64 cdrom, hd-media, monolithic, and netboot
      initrds, so that rootskel can turn the fan on.
    - Use dependency resolution for ide-modules, nic-modules,
      pcmcia-storage-modules, scsi-common-modules, scsi-modules, and
      usb-storage-modules on powerpc, and remove several modules from
      powerpc-extra-modules that only belong on certain images. This removes
      cdrom-core-modules and fs-common-modules from netboot images, and adds
      parport-modules to apus/cdrom (I think it was missing by mistake).
    - Add support for kernel-specific pkg-lists entries: use lines like
      "package [2.2 2.4]" or "package * [2.6]". Should eventually form a
      simpler replacement for the kernel_specific directory.
    - Include initrd.list on amd64/i386 images.
    - Add hd-media image for powerpc, including a boot.img.gz designed for
      use on USB sticks.
    - Document USB booting on powerpc. This involved splitting out the
      documentation for USB booting on i386 a bit.
    - Since power3 and power4 no longer build images with the 2.4 kernel,
      remove their KERNELVERSION_2.4 variables and kernel-build-2.4*
      build-dependencies.
    - Switch libparted1.6-0 build-dependency to libparted1.6-12.
    - Fix support for multiple words in KERNELVERSION.

  * Joshua Kwan
    - Change sparc kernels to use 2.6.8-2 udebs.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add new usb-modules to sparc64 images to support usb keyboard on sun
      blades.
    - Move all utilities in build/ into build/util/, except daily-build,
      which is hardcoded in many cron jobs.
    - Fix two cases where the pkg-lists dependency checker printed warnings
      about dependencies that were actually ok.
    - Manual correction re debconf/priority.
    - Don't fail to build if sources.list has a cdrom entry in it
      (don't try to use the cdrom as a udeb source, either).
    - Switch i386, ia64, alpha, hppa, and s390 to use the -2 kernel abiname.
    - Add text frontend to alpha netboot image for general old-timey keenness.
    - Dropped hppa 2.4 images.
    - Removed various things from the hppa 2.6 netboot initrd to make
      it small enough to work again.
    - Add cdrom-modules to hppa cdrom initrd, this is a new package as of the
      -2 kernel.
    - Add socket-modules to all hppa initrds, also newly modularised.
  * Bdale Garbee
    - hppa 2.6 cdrom initrd needs more modules

  * Joey Hess
    - Add module-init-tools to build deps for ia64 to fix truncated
      modules.dep files and USB keyboard.
    - Add it for sparc too.
    - Add discover1 to even the 2.4 hppa images. Yes, there are no modules
      there, but this allows the de4x5 blacklist code in hw-detect to notice
      that discover1 wants to load de4x5, and blacklist it, avoiding a
      crash when the installed system boots.
    - Add 2.6 netboot image for hppa. Includes a move of the 2.4 netboot
      image into the netboot/ directory for consistency.
    - Fix SUITE setting so debian/rules can override it. I guess this never
      worked as intended before!
  * Christian Perrier
    - Add 7 missing characters to installer/build/needed-characters/ar
      Thanks to Naidim Shaikli and Arabeyes contributors

    - Finish moving installation howto to manual.
    - Remove now-useless index.en.html.
    - 24 mb installs are now possible on i386.

    - Bump genext2fs build dep to avoid building images with broken versions.
    - Remove the ugly and no longer needed genext2fs size hack.

      menu screen.
    - Make ia64 boot screens somewhat more generic so they can be used for
      netboot or other image types besides CD.
    - Use only one elilo.conf for netboot and CD.
    - Revamp the ia64 netboot, provide a netboot.tar.gz image that contains
      a fully preconfigured netboot setup with boot menus for 2.6 and 2.4.
      Make the dest tree have the same layout.
    - Add -- markers to elilo.cfg boot options.
    - Update i386 and amd64 netboot to follow ia64. Note that the tarballs
      have been renamed.
    - Fix ia64 miniiso support to not hardcode use of specific boot image,
      remove the miniiso type, and generate a netboot miniiso instead.
    - Simplify bootscreen-subst parameters.
    - Based on a patch from Alex Owen, make syslinux help screens explain
      on serial consoles how to press function keys there, and add a pxelinux
      config file for 9600 baud serial consoles, available by changing the
      pxelinux.cfg link.
    - Comment out the "NewWorld MacOS Installation Files" section of the
      install manual as it's out of date and has broken links. Closes: #269526
    - Add support for depenency resolution to pkg-lists. For now it has to be
      turned on on a per-package basis by appending an asterisk to the line,
      since many udebs have messed up dependencies and inter-image
      dependencies are not accounted for.
    - Make pkg-list warn about unsatisfied dependencies.
    - Use dependency resolution for the nic-modules package, as its
      dependencies vary from arch to arch and kernel to kernel. Fixes various
      missing deps on i386 and ia64.
    - Use dependency resolution for scsi-modules to get rid of the
      kernel_specific hack.
    - Drop scsi-modules and usb-storage-modules from ia64 netboot image.
    - Put efi-reader on ia64 cdrom image.
    - Remove ia64-extra-modules hack, not needed thanks to nic-modules and
      scsi-modules dependency resolution.
    - Add dependencies of nic-usb-modules to net-drivers floppy (usb-modules
      was missing).
    - Remove useless (and missing dependencies) usb-storage-modules from
      cd-drivers floppy. This made space to add back full pcmcia support on
      this floppy.
    - Add options to elilo boot menu for serial console installs, as I tire
      of typing them.
    - Split access-drivers floppy into net and cd drivers and updated these
      floppies to 2.4.27.
    - Remove ide and scsi modules from various arches netboot images.
    - Move some files to a doc/devel subdirectory.
    - Moved partman docs over from packages/partman, and build them as part
      of the doc build process. Add build dep on debiandoc-sgml.
    - Also moved in partman-auto recipe documentation.
    - Added example preseed file for automated installs.
    - Rewrote design.txt.
    - Use text frontend for ia64 installs via serial console by default,
      since the default ia64 serial console is 9600 baud.
    - Add English to i386 root floppies. Closes: #269971
    - Set build date to the version date from the changelog when doing
      official builds, so all builds of a given version claim the same date.
    - Add a dummy entry to the status file for that gives the overall version
      of the installer image.
    - Build-Depend on syslinux 2.11-0.1 to get fix for parameter bug.
    - Drop all languages from root floppy. Drop all other localised versions
      of root floppy. Document how to make a custom root floppy containing
      the language(s) you need.
      (PC 101: If you can't satisfy everyone, satisfy no-one.)
    - Move countrychooser back to the root floppy.
    - Add wireless-tools-udeb and nic-usb-modules to the root floppy because
      we have the space, so why not?
    - Update hppa to 2.4.27 kernel. Without testing it, but the 2.4.25 kernel
      udebs are no longer available. We need hppa developers..
    - Patch from Jö Fahlke to consistently refer to DEBCONF_FRONTEND in docs.

    - Switch mips and mipsel over to 2.4.27.
    - Put USB and input modules on the sb1-swarm-bn/netboot initrd to allow
      "desktop like" installations with framebuffer and USB keyboards.
    - Make sure that the serial console on Cobalt gets turned on.
    - Update installation menu for mips and mipsel.
    - Cleanup the ARM config files: declare most variables in one place and

      work.
    - Don't clean at the end of the daily build (we already clean at the
      start).
    - Move socket-modules from powerpc root-2 to root, otherwise syslogging
      won't work.
    - Remove serial-modules from root-2. It's only needed for strange PPP
      stuff which is not needed on the floppies.
    - Remove PCMCIA support and wireless tools from root-2. The floppies are
      only needed on OldWorld, which probably either won't have PCMCIA or
      will have built-in networking. In the rare cases where this might be
      needed, you can always throw the udeb on a floppy.
    - Remove nic-extra-modules from powerpc net-drivers. We've changed the
      module udebs so that all drivers likely to be needed on OldWorld are
      in nic-modules.
    - Move everything else from root-2 to net-drivers, and remove root-2.

    - Remove ipv6-modules and wireless-tools-udeb from the i386 net-drivers
      floppy to get back under the floppy size limit. Closes: #261625
    - Numerous fixes and updates to the installer manual, including
      improved docs on PXE booting for i386 (Closes: #232252),
      rewritten section of downloading files that avoids bad links and
      outdated image names (Closes: #246890), document ramdisk_size for lilo
      and grub booting better (Closes: #255821).
    - i386 kernel no longer support rarp, disable that in install manual.
      Closes: #250027 ; Same for hppa. Closes: #250026
    - Integrate installation howto into manual. The old text format howto is
      left for now until we update all links and docs to point to the new one.
    - Full package builds build the manual in official build mode.
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Kill second set of m68k initrds, genext2fs seems to work.
    - Add /dev/null to userdevfs-dev.txt.
    - Update m68k manual.
  * Colin Watson
    - Document 'install video=ofonly' instead of 'install-safe', which is
      going away (it caused combinatorial explosion in the yaboot prompt on
      full CDs).
    - Add fb-modules and floppy-modules to powerpc cdrom and netboot
      initrds.
  * Bastian Blank

  * Sven Luther
    - Removed the -chrp image and renamed the -chrp-rs6k to -chrp,
      as the addnote doesn't stop it from working on chrp.
    - Fixed build for 2.6 -chrp kernels with builtin initrd.
      only prep is missing now.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add usb-storage-modules and scsi-common-modules to the powerpc cdrom
      initrds.
    - Add cdrom-core-modules, input-modules, firewire-core-modules, and
      scsi-core-modules to the powerpc 2.6 cdrom initrds. Should actually
      work now.
    - Add pcmcia udebs to powerpc net_drivers floppy and netboot images.
    - Move $(TREE)/usr/lib/kernel-image-$(KERNELVERSION) out of the way to
      $(TEMP)/lib when building boot images. powerpc subarchitectures that
      need to use mkvmlinuz should now be able to do so.
    - For every initrd, output an initrd.list file containing the packages
      and their versions used to construct it.
    - debootstrap-udeb is now priority optional. Add it back into monolithic
      images.
    - Drop G5 images; power4 works on G5s as of linux-kernel-di-powerpc-2.6
      0.62. Build power4 netboot 2.6 images.
    - Remove install-safe and expert-safe targets, advising people to add
      'video=ofonly' instead. The -safe targets have got rather out of hand
      on full CDs, so I'd like to think about removing them there.
    - daily-build copies the previous build before rsyncing up the new one.
      This saved 82MB of upload for my powerpc build.
    - Add nic-shared-modules to powerpc netboot images, needed by
      nic-modules.
    - Bump powerpc 2.6 kernels to 2.6.7. Add firmware-modules, much as on
      i386.
    - Build-depend on module-init-tools on architectures with 2.6 images.

      is full again.
    - Fix stats for images without kernels.
    - Fixes to INSTALLATION-HOWTO from Jan Minar. Closes: #253868
    - Change netcfg/use_dhcp to netcfg/disable_dhcp in syslinux boot screens
      and elsewhere.
    - Update i386 to the 2.6.7 kernel.
    - Add firmware-modules to i386 images that have either nic-modules or
      scsi-modules on them. Make this happen only for the 2.6 kernel, using a
      nasty pkg-lists/kernel_specific technique since we lack dependency
      resolution in pkg-lists.
    - Go back to pulling udebs from unstable when building official images.
    - Produce a single hd-media boot image that includes both kernels.
    - Parameterise filenames and paths in the syslinux.cfg files so that
      files can have different names or locations.
    - Provide a pxeboot.tar.gz on i386 that can just be untarred into a
      tftpserver file space for easy PXE boot setup, and update
      INSTALLATION-HOWTO.
    - Merge the i386 and amd64 syslinux data and image build code.

    - Add a configuration script to the Cobalt images for automatic
      TFTP boot.
    - Add socket-modules to the SWARM netboot image.
    - Temporarily remove modules for USB detection from the SWARM
      netboot images since we don't have the right kernel modules yet.
    - Remove fdisk-udeb from the mipsel netboot and cdrom images and
      from the arm netboot images.
    - Add little-endian netboot images for the SWARM.
    - Add a monolithic image for SWARM on mips and mipsel for testing
      purposes, but don't active it by default.
    - Add mdcfg-utils and mdadm-udeb to pkg-lists/monolithic/common;
      partman-md needs it.
    - Add lvm2-udeb and libdevmapper1.00-udeb to pkg-lists/monolithic/common
      for partman-lvm.
    - Build-depend on version 1.3-5 or higher of genext2fs in order to fix
      initrd problems found and fixed by Vince Sanders.

    - busybox is not longer kernel dependent.
    - Only call depmod if there are modules in the tree.

  * Thiemo Seufer
    - mips config cleanup, no changes in behaviour.
    - Cleanup the Makefile's System.map handling.
  * Joey Hess
    - Add cdrom-core-modules to hd-media as it is not on the iso,
      and partman needs to find cdroms to set up the fstab properly.
    - Add pcmcia-storage-modules to the cd-drivers floppy. The rest of pcmcia
      support is too lasge to fit on the floppy, so for now the net-drivers
      floppy will also have to be loaded to access pcmcia cdroms.
    - Update i386 kernel to 2.4.26 (with the SATA backports).
    - Add sata-modules to hd-media and to the isolinux image.
    - Add nic-usb-modules to net-drivers floppy.
    - Document noapic on f5.txt. Closes: #238609
    - Set apt to retry 3 times to guard against intermittent network problems
      and make builds more robust.
    - Move firewire stuff to isolinux CD initrd; the el-toritoc CD initrd
      is full.
    - Remove ppp-modules udeb from net_drivers floppy images, which do not
      have ppp-udeb on them.
    - Pull udebs from testing when building official images.
    - Disable monolithic image type on i386, because it is large, mostly
      useful for testing, and currenlty cannot build against testing because
      of a missing mdcfg-utils.
  * Colin Watson
    - Reduce the four cloned-and-hacked yaboot.conf files to one, with the
      type substituted in at build time.
    - Remove redundant discover1-udeb and discover1-data-udeb from powerpc
      monolithic list.
    - Add cramfs initrd support.
    - Add support for powerpc 2.6 installs, currently monolithic-only.
    - stats targets cope with TEMP_INITRD being empty.
    - powerpc-small root floppy was out of space; split off an asian-root
      floppy, the same as we already have for i386. Closes: #246958
    - Drop console-keymaps-amiga from non-apus powerpc initrds.
    - Add lvmcfg-utils to pkg-lists/monolithic/common for now; partman-lvm
      needs it.
    - Arrange for there actually to be a kernel on the powerpc-small boot
      floppy again. This is slightly moot, though, as we don't have miboot
      yet so it's still not bootable ...
    - Add eject-udeb to powerpc CDs.
    - Comment out powerpc monolithic target again, since the images tarball
      is already quite enormous enough and monolithic is mainly intended for
      developer testing.
    - Add leading slash to "etc/hostname" in manual (closes: #249101).

    - Add logo by Alessandro Polverini and Andrea Mottola.
      Not the default until the Debian version is corrected though.
    - Add logo copyright info to debian/copyright.
    - Fix access floppy building with 2.6 kernel, same as root floppy was
      fixed earlier.
    - Out of space on the root floppy again. Split off a asian-root floppy.
    - Remove the pcmcia stuff from the cd-drivers floppy, it was too big.
    - Force the driver floppies to be of size FLOPPY_SIZE.
    - Add custom-kernel.txt
    - Add new image type, "monolithic", which build an initrd and a miniiso
      that contain all standard priority udebs, and does not need any other
      udebs to install Debian. This simple image type will be much easier to
      use for custom d-i builds, as you don't need to set up a CD or a mirror.
      It's also great for testing changes to $RANDOM_UDEB.
    - Add build-dep on grep-dctrl, used by monolithic image build process.
    - Add build-dep on bzip2 for powerpc, used by powerpc-builtin-initrd.sh to
      unpack the kernel tree.
    - Add build-dep on libparted1.6-0, needed during monolithic build
      due to versioned dependencies sillyness.

  * Joey Hess
    - Add udebs to support pcmcia cdroms to the pkg-lists for isolinux initrd,
      and to the cd-drivers floppy.
    - Add the kernel udeb to the root floppy pkg lists. It will be removed
      from the free dring build, but this will both give us an entry for the
      kernel in the status file, to prevent anna from doing bad things, and
      also will provide a System.map for depmod to run against, fixing
      builds on 2.6 kernels.
    - Removed the demo type.
    - Changed make demo and make shell to per-type targets.
    - Fixed the uml target similarly.
    - Added a qemu target, currently it can only handle booting floppies.
    - Remove broken and useless debian-installer-demo package.
      Closes: #218560

      load-floppy now runs before it.
    - Reenable all translations for root floppy again, though this can't last.
    - Always include /dev/console, even for images that will use devfs.
      This means that netboot users will not have to remember the devfs=mount.
    - Left devfs=mount in syslinux.cfg anyway, out of general caution.
    - Add another dh_testroot call before udebs are downloaded.
    - Document debian-installer/probe/usb=false in syslinux f7.txt.
    - Docs are now included in the source package.
    - Remove the INSTALLATION-HOWTO copy hack.

    - Allow passing languages and arches to manual/build/build.sh in env
      variables.

      This caused the build to put modules.dep in the wrong directory, causing
      modprobe to fail - will need linux-kernel-di 0.50 to build.

    - Add a kernel to the demo image type, because this is necessary to get
      the System.map so depmod will work on 2.6. The kernel is currently
      included in the demo image; I suppose you could use it somehow, and I

      uses the smaller initrd so it will still fit on El Torito.

    - set the syslinux timeout to 0 on floppys, to match the CD
    - put syslinux boot screens back on boot floppy and hd-media
    - copy System.map to $(TEMP) instead of deleting it, I understand sparc
      needs this
    - add the libiw27-udeb to every list that includes netcfg
    - add libdebconfclient to pkg-lists/base; it is marginally smaller than
      having mklibs copy in the system one. Remove build-dep.
    - same for libdebian-installer-4-udeb, although it is not currently any
      smaller
    - before running mklibs, copy all the libs from lib and usr/lib in the
      initrd to a temporary directory, and add that to mklib's search path
      with -L. This will make it avoid copying in large versions of libs from
      the build system if there is already a small version available in the

    - Hack syslinux.txt so it all fits on one line, the same line as the boot:
      prompt.
    - Add ${BOOTPROMPT} expansion to bootscreen-subst, to make it easy
      to make the last line in a syslinux screen not have a newline at EOF
      on the image, while still being easily editable.
    - Switch cdroms from load-installer to load-cdrom. This is to work around
      limitations in main-menu (see #218774). Driver floppy loading will now
      be started by cdrom-detect if it fails to find a CD.
    - Version the mtools build-dep. Closes: #225584
    - Let HOST, BASEDIR, or DIR be set in the environment before running
      daily-build, to override the defaults.

      dest/netboot/mini.iso that behaves the same as a netboot would.
    - Add a dest/cdrom/debian-cd_info.tar.gz with the syslinux screens
      and splash image, for eventual use by debian-cd.

  * Joey Hess
    - Generate bootable hd-media images, not just the initrd.
      These can be written directly the usb memory stick, then mounted
      and a d-i iso copied in. As they're quite big (and sparse),
      they are gzipped.
    - NB: The above change means you need 128+ mb more free space to
      build this package on i386.
    - If System.map is included in the kernel image udeb, pass it to depmod
      via -F and delete it when done. This is to support building on systems
      running 2.6.
    - Remove ide modules stuff from net drivers floppy. I don't know why it
      was there, but its deps were not met and this could cause ugly messages
      during install.
    - Remove the same ide modules from i386 netboot.
    - Document the bootkbd boot parameter in syslinux f7.txt.
    - Add "expert" mode boot to syslinux, which sets DEBCONF_PRIORITY=low.
    - Include a doc/index.en.html in the install-images tarball, so
      debian-cd will find some documentation and not include the boot floppies
      docs.
    - Include INSTALLATION-HOWTO there too, by way of a gross, gross hack.
    - netcfg reorg
    - scsi-common-modules reorg
    - Grep out several encodings that confuse reduce-font:
      ISO-8859-*, EUC-JP, CP1251. This is a temporary hackaround to get it
      building again.
    - Access floppy filled up, so move the network stuff to the access_drivers
      floppy. That filled up access_drivers, so comment out SCSI support at
      least for now.
    - Turn ia64 back on, let's see if it builds now.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Build the demo tree only for architectures which support it.
    - Don't build images for the demo target.
    - Ensure TYPE=demo for the Makefile's demo target.
    - Remove stamp files for tree and get_udebs at the begin of their rule,
      create them at the rule's end.
    - Ignore errors for the all_clean target.
    - Don't use USERDEVFS for linux-mips.
    - Fix 'make clean' if type demo is unsupported.
  * Marco d'Itri
    - Add preliminary support for .ko kernel modules.

debian-installer (20031212) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Switch i386 to using dhcp-client rather than pump for netboot.
      Left it using pump on other arches that did not already use dhcp-client,
      at least for now.
    - Switch i386, hppa, and ia64 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp
      on the root floppy.
    - Switch powerpc to pump on the root floppy.
    - Switch i386 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp on the access floppy.
    - Switch from pump to dhcp-client on powerpc.
    - Add disk labels to the i386 floppy images, for use by the bootfloppy
      initrd, and maybe later by the floppy retreiver, etc.
    - In debian/rules, if the changelog is unreleased, use unstable as the
      DISTRIBUTION.
    - makelabel takes the build date as its second parameter. Calculating
      BUILD_DATE once at the start to avoid inconsistencies during
      long/midnight builds.
    - Add MEDIA_TYPE to configs for bootable image types.
    - Add DEBIAN_VERSION to config.
    - Add bootscreen-subst to substitute these variables into boot screens.
    - Make a syslinux help screen, for all i386 syslinuxed boot media.
      Includes the build date, debian version, and media type, and is derived
      from isolinux help texts on the sarge cds, but modified to actually
      match d-i:
        - remove boot flavor docs, as we currently have no flavors
        - remove rescue stuff, as d-i is not currently also a rescue disk
        - reduce number of colors used for cleaner look
        - remove mention of non-free
        - try to make the prerequisites documentation somewhere close to
          reality -- 64 mb ram and 256 mb disk.
        - make every boot message screen 22 lines long, followed by a blank
          line (which is in turn followed by the boot: prompt), for consistent
          display
        - remove references in f4.txt to a nonexistant table
        - remove documentation of mono and vga16:off, as they do not work with
          d-i
        - remove keytimer hack documentation, that was for boot-floppies
        - add documentation of d-i's boot time parameters, including the new
          debian-installer/framebuffer=false
        - remove the mailing list subscription info; boot time is not the
          time to tell the user about this. In its place, make f9.txt be
          about Debian.
      - Remove DEBCONF_DEBUG setting from syslinux.cfg.
      - Use bootscreen-subst on powerpc's boot.msg, too.
      - Comment out the udeb apt status file stuff in get-packages, now is not
        the time to be breaking the build with that.
      - Build depend on elilo on ia64. This had better be the last one.
  * Goswin von Brederlow
    - Moved fetching of (u)debs into get-packages shell script.
    - Changed sources.list to sources.list.udeb, added sources.list.deb.
    - Allowed "deb file:/..." urls in /etc/apt/sources.list, (Closes: #221031)
      simplified sed expression and change file to copy urls.
    - Add explaining error message when apt-get update fails
    - get-packages: Only seed dpkg status with libs when getting udebs
    - pkg-lists/cdrom/alpha: missing input-modules-${kernel:Version}
    - pkg-lists/mirror_udeb: lists for a partial mirror suitable for the CDs
    - Drop pump-udeb (netboot on alpha, s390 and sparc) in favour of
      dhcp-client-udeb
    - debain/control: added Build-Depends: mkisofs
    - daily-build: changed to copy last days images and rsync new ones
    - daily-build: don't let the builder wait for logs, use tee
    - No discover for mips/mipsel
    - Added arch mips to the debian-installer.deb (Closes: #221534)
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Fix error handling in tftpboot.sh
  * Chris Tillman
    - Add DEBCONF_PRIORITY note to powerpc boot message.
    - Add MacRISC3 & 4 to ofboot.b for compatibility with G4/G5 powerpcs
  * Mario Lang
    - Add new boot floppy flavour "speakup" which uses a speakup-enabled
      kernel version.
    - Update the access flavour to use the same kernel version as the
      speakup flavour.
    - Update the access_drivers common and i386 pkg-list.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Sanitize tftpboot.sh. It aborts now on errors and won't move/copy
      files around without good reason. Changed mipsel image generation
      to t-rex.
    - Add pkg-lists/netboot/mips.
    - Add fdisk to the mips/mipsel CD images, add AT keyboard support
      to mips image.
    - Add AT keyboard support to mips demo image.
    - Polish make/arch/linux-mips{,el} a bit.
    - Switch config/arch/linux-mips to kernel 2.4.22 with -di flavour.

debian-installer (20031113) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add new loop-modules to bootfloppy, hd-media.
    - Move input-modules from root floppy to bootfloppy, as the new
      rootskel-bootfloppy prompts for the user to hit enter.
    - Remove redundant usb-discover and usb-modules from root floppy;
      the boot floppy takes care of that.
    - Remove fat-modules and floppy-modules from the root floppy; they
      boot floppy loads them.
    - Create DEST before copying in DEST_KERNEL.
    - ia64 build-depends on dosfstools. Closes: #219919
    - sparc build-depends on genromfs. Closes: #220208
    - remove brltty from everything except access. It is causing problems
      (#219928) on sparc at least.
    - add nic-extra-modules to netboot for i386, as it fits and netboot
      should support as much as it can
    - try to get full UTF-8 going on netboot
    - add nano to netboot
  * Richard Hirst
    - Add mtools as a build-dep for ia64

debian-installer (20031109) unstable; urgency=low

  * Richard Hirst
    - Remove efi-reader from ia64 cdrom pkglist for now; the one in the
      archive is linked against libdebian-installer3 which is no longer
      available.
    - Stop including debootstrap-udeb in cdrom pkg-list for ia64.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 07 Nov 2003 22:31:07 +0000

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 2003 15:12:48 -0500

debian-installer (20031106) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved the copyright file, decided not to try to list the copyright

  * New retriever menu setup:
    - add load-floppy and download-installer to floppy
    - add load-installer to cdrom, netboot
    - add load-iso to hd-media
    - add load-cdrom, hw-detect-full, ide-core-modules, and cdrom-detect

  * Remove pcmcia-udeb from pkg-lists, hw-detect took over.
  * Make d-i-demo catch SIGINT, clean up properly.
  * Fix kernel module package names in udeb_include for driver floppies.
  * Alastair McKinstry:
    - Add additional shade characters to fix the scroll bar in the newt
      frontend.
    - The terminfo entries are now provided by di-utils-terminfo, not
      the Makefile.
  * Richard Hirst:
    - Misc ia64 fixes - define KERNEL_FLAVOUR, clean up pkglists, etc
  * Improved the description of debian-installer-demo. Closes: #219255

debian-installer (20031029) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This includes a deb that lets a demo of the installer be run
    (and triggers autobuilders), but the main payload is the
    debian-installer-images tarball, which is designed to be unpacked
    by ftp-master into the ftp site.
  * Set architecture to i386, powerpc for now. More will be added
    once d-i works on them well enough to distribute images.
