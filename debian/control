#		For creating ext2 filesystems without being root.
#		1.3-7.1 fixes issues on several arches.
	e2fsprogs,
#		genext2fs doesn't produce perfect filesystems, so we fsck
#		them.

#		count on it remaining so.

#		For making mini isos.

#		m68k uses it for atari floppies
#		armhf uses it for building bootable SD card images
	cpio (>= 2.11+dfsg-6),
#		For creating (reproducible) initramfs images.
	pigz,
#		For compressing various files.
	xz-utils,
#		For compressing initramfs images.

#		Booting and other tools for Atari systems.
	vmelilo [m68k],
	m68k-vme-tftplilo [m68k],
