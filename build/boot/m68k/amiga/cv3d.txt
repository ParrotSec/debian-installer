The kernel used for this boot-floppies includes the new virgefb driver.
I copied the instructions from http://people.debian.org/~cts/virge/ here.
The instructions for the old driver are still included at the bottom, in
case you still have a kernel with the old driver.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
New virgefb driver (for CyberVison64/3D)

The new virgefb driver can initialize the CV3D board. This means that you do
not have to switch the resolution under AmigaOS to the resolution you want
to use with Linux. But it also means, you have to pass correct video
parameters to make the kernel boot. And it should now be possible to use
amiga-lilo on CV3D based machines (untested).

Here comes a list of video options, I have used on my (ZorroII) box: 

amiboot -k vmlinuz root=/dev/sda4 video=virge:virge8
amiboot -k vmlinuz root=/dev/sda4 video=virge:640x480-8
amiboot -k vmlinuz root=/dev/sda4 video=virge:800x600-8
amiboot -k vmlinuz root=/dev/sda4 video=virge:1024x768-8
amiboot -k vmlinuz root=/dev/sda4 video=virge:1280x1024-8

Selecting the resolution during boot

All video options have to start with video=virge:, parameters follow after
the colon.

You can use virge8 or virge16 to get a standard 8 (or 16) bit mode,
currently this is set in the source to use the 800x600 resolution.

You can specify the resolution and depth as in XRESxYRES-DEPTH. The
resolutions supported during boot are: 640x480, 768x576, 800x600, 1024x768,
1152x886, 1280x1024, 1600x1200.  Resolutions 1024x768 and higher can also be
used as interlace modes (append an i after the depth).  Also supported is
one double scan mode at 320x240, ie 320x240-8d.  The supported depths are 8,
16 and 32 (32-bit not tested on ZorroII).

Changing the resolution (running system)

The vertical refresh frequency might not be what you want after booting (or
starting X11) with the new driver. This may also depend on whether you got
the source from Ken, or if I had my hands on it, using slightly larger fV
than Ken (and ones which do not cause the OSD of my monitor to become
flaky). However, the good news is, you can use fbset to set the resolution
and fV you want. A few examples:

fbset 1024x768-75 # resolution of 1024x768 with fV of 75Hz
fbset -a 800x600-80 # switch all consoles to 800x600 with 80Hz

To change the resolution for your X11 display, you should consult
/usr/doc/xserver-fbdev/README.Debian.  Using openvt -c 7 fbset 1280x1024-60
(for vt 7) is reported to work when you call it (as root) just before
startx.

For xdm, this was reported to work: 

"openvt -c 7 -- fbset " (assuming that X is on vt7) in /etc/init.d/xdm
just before the X server is actually started.

You can also change the resolution within a running X "on the fly" by ctr-alt-+ (or -) provided your XF86Config is configured properly. 

   SubSection "Display"
        Depth       8  
        Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        Virtual     1024 768

Besides the Modes, you also have to supply a Virtual resolution (currently
only tested with X 3.3.6).

How to use the CV3D driver under Linux/m68k
Author:  Christian T. Steigies (cts@debian.org)
Date:    09.02.1999

This doc contains only the most important things to note for using the CV3D,
for more info on CyberGrafiX modes, please read the cv64 doc from Alan Bair.

The driver originally supported only Zorro3 systems, but since 2.0.36 and
2.1.131 it also supports Zorro2 (it works with my A2000, but I have heard of
problems with Zorro boards in A1200).
The driver does not yet initialize the board, so you have to select under
Amiga OS the video mode you want to use under linux.

Kernel 2.0.36
-------------
Available modes (8 bit only):
   640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1152x886, 1280x1024, 1600x1200

add video=virgefb:<mode> to the bootline, ie:
   amiboot -v -k vmlinux root=/dev/sda1 video=virgefb:640x480-8


Kernel 2.1.131/2.2.x
--------------------
Available modes (8 bit):
   640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1152x886, 1280x1024, 1600x1200
Available modes (16 bit):
   640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1152x886, 1280x1024(?)

add video=virge:<mode> to the bootline, ie:
   amiboot -v -k vmlinux root=/dev/sda1 video=virge:640x480-8

Notice the difference between 2.0 and 2.1 kernels (virgefb <-> virge).

16 bit modes are working on Zorro2 and Zorro3, allthough they are very slow,
at least on Zorro2. 16 bit does not make much sense on the console and is not
supported by xfree 3.3.2.3. It is supposed to work with xfree 3.3.3, though.

TODO:
- code to initialize the board, so that you can use a 800x600 mode on the
  console, which is readable very well, and 1024x768 or more with xfree.
- 24/32 bit modes (slower than very slow???)
- hardwarecursor (where will this be used?)
