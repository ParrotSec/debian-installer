The quick installation guide is in install.doc. For the official and much
more detailed instructions, look for the html, pdf and txt documents in the
doc directory. Note that both documents are not totally in sync, if you have
enhancements or error corrections, please send a diff to
 debian-68k@lists.debian.org
the people on debian-boot or, best option, apply for maintainership and
check it in yourself.
You can use this address also if you have any questions (after reading the
FAQs of course). It might also be helpful to browse the debian WWW pages or
have a look at www.debian.org/~cts/debian-m68k
Here I try to keep things that I find useful for m68k and which have not
made it into the release, on the CDs, etc (like the famous missing
XF86Config in the slink release).

Good luck,
Christian <cts@debian.org>
