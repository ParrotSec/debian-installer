This directory should contain, for each language supported in Debian
Installer, one file, named after the language ISO_639 code (fr.utf for
French, de.utf for German and so on).

This file should contain all non ASCII characters used for the language
in the installer. In general you can list all characters, but if you know
the installer will never have a message containing a given character (such
as the Euro sign), please leave it out to save space.

It is allowed to add characters that can be entered directly using a
"standard" keyboard for the language and are printed on the tops of keys,
for example as displayed on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keymap. This
includes characters accessible through alt-gr and characters that can be
created using dead keys.

Please include ALL needed characters (see "fr.utf" file as example) even if
they are already included in another file for another language.

The file MUST be UTF-8 encoded.

At the moment this file is written, this is needed for latin languages and
languages with reasonably sized non-latin alphabets. In general, if your
language uses hundreds or thousands of characters, this file is the wrong
approach, and you should instead look at the bterm-unifont udeb.

It is also requested to NOT put such file when the given language is
only available in the graphical version of the installer.

When a language is a "prospective" language, this file should use the
".prospective" extension.

These files (plus the templates files for everything on the initrd) will be
used for building the reduced font that goes onto the initrd images. This
font needs to be as tiny as possible but needs to support all necessary
languages characters.
