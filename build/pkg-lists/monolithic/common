# Include all standard priority udebs and all kernel modules matching the
# kernel onto the miniiso. The idea is that here we have a very simple form
# of d-i that does not need a Packages file anywhere, so it much easier to
# build. These lists are produced during build.

# Other udebs that are not standard priority, but are still needed.
# Note that some of these are due to broken dependencies of standard
# priority udebs.
